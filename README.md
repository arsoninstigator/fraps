made a 3d website using html a-frame on replit. i created a little robot made using only smaller shapes being evil and committing arson (no im not a pyromaniac i pinky promise). i actually like a-frame so much it's so easy to use, i cannot wait to build more projects using it and make it a part of my regularly used stack.

you can see the live demo of the final screen on replit [here](https://replit.com/@arsoninstigator/BigDangerousScreenscraper)
